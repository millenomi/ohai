An input map maps keyboard events to "intents", probable user intentions. The built-in maps enable you to receive page navigation, action, 4-way arrows, text input and 'advanced controls' intents by mapping them to the known key layouts of the current device.

\bug For now, this class only supports the Hanlin V3.
