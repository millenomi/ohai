 An application object represents your app. Application objects run the run loop and allow for graceful app shutdown when needed.

 Application objects, just like in AppKit or UIKit, aren't usually subclassed. Instead, they send messages to another object, the application delegate. OIApplication retains its delegate.
 
 The application object is a responder and is intended to be the "top" of all responder chains (that is, the object all events are ultimately forwarded to if unhandled). By default, it does not declare the use of any OIMap and has no intent delegate.
 
 Applications are singletons; there is only one application instance in each app. The singleton is created the first time the OIApplication::sharedApplication method is called, and is of the class it is first called on (OIApplication or the desired subclass, if any).
